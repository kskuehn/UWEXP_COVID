We all had to contribute something""
""I was taking down notes from the slides being presented and then trying to solve the problems...I would watch the lecture watch a chunk, pause it, write notes do stuff and then continue watching.""
""...I enjoyed about math is that there is a group of three to four lectures would be there'd be a deadline...each lecture was worth like one point... So having that deadline worked really well and I was kind of like all students were forced to watch to watch us on a timely manner.""
""And live classes. I felt like it was much easier to engage in those because they allowed me to...it was live. I felt like I had to be there and I had to put my effort and time into watching and participating."""

""Advising was really nice because on zoom. I could just get on right away. I didn't have to run to like chemistry whole building and then you can't lose her taking lunch. So then you have to wait out the hallway like it was just much more efficient on Zune (Zoom).  
""I really liked zoom office hours especially I felt like this past quarter. I went to more office hours than I had in previous quarters. I think I attended a total of Like six office hours. And I would say in a typical quarter I for like my education classes. Specifically I would go to like maybe one or two. Okay. They felt with it being on zoom. They felt more accessible.  Um it felt like any quick question that I had could be answered with like a five minute drop into a zoom office hour rather than like a 15 minute walk to my professors building to ask a five minute question to walk 15 minutes back. It was a lot of my professors were really nice about zoom office hours because they made it seem like they appreciated like physical interaction or like face to face interaction that we would have even more because they were like please visit me during office hours. Like I will just be sitting there otherwise. And so it was like nice because I felt Like more valued attending those. 
""Because a big part of officers (office hours) in person is like hearing what (other students have to say) have to say but other students are able to like discuss with other students.""
Another student who never went to office hours when they weren't online, went frequently this quarter. 
Some students missed the community and peer consultation that occurred in in-person office hours."

I didn't have to run to like (the) chemistry building and then...her taking lunch. So then you have to wait out the hallway. Like it was just much more efficient on Zoom.""
 ""Um actually I think the TA office hours were a lot more helpful than they would be in person because normally you'd have like one room one TA and then they might go around helping each person.""
""I attended one of my professors office hours and they she had said like please stop by. If you just want to talk about all the protests going on or your feelings about anything....so I dropped in to ask for her opinion...offered the opportunity to talk to her and just be very vulnerable with her even though we weren't in person was really nice. And definitely like helped me when I needed it."""

At home his mother watched streaming church services but this didn't appeal to him, only interrupted his academic focus. "
